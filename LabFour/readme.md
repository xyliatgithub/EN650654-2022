# Lab 4 - Intrusion Detection Systems on GENI

In this lab assignment, you will get familiar with the intrusion detection system of Snort. 

The goals of this lab are:
1.	To get you acquainted with Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs)
2.	To install an IDS on a real machine
3.	To use the IDS to detect Denial of Service Attacks
4.	To create and study IDS rules
5.	To study IDS logs and understand them

## Setup

Go to http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/lab_env.html to install the pre-built VM image (Ubuntu 16.04 32 bits).

- VM setup instruction (in Virtualbox): http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs_16.04/Documents/SEEDVM_VirtualBoxManual.pdf
- User manual (contains the usernames and passowrds): http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Documentation/Ubuntu16_04_VM/Ubuntu16_04_VM_Manual.pdf

In this lab, you need to have three VMs under the same local network. Note that these three VMs should be in the promiscuous mode in order to listen to traffics from other VMs. Once you have configured a VM, you can simply clone that VM for two more times to complete the VM setup. Please refer to Appendix A and B of the VM setup instruction.
